🎬 Royalty Studioz Website
📖 Project Purpose

This project is a multi-page website for Royalty Studioz, a Christian short-film studio.
The goal is to showcase the company’s mission, highlight its first short film, and provide visitors with an easy way to connect with the studio.
It was built as part of my assignment to demonstrate HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript skills, responsive design, and deployment to a live hosting service.
